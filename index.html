        <h2>What is the importance of Christian baptism</h2>
        <h3>January 26, 2024</h3>
        <img src="./images/baptism.jpg" alt="Study Group 2 Image" />
        <p>
          Christian baptism is one of two ordinances that Jesus instituted for
          the church. Just before His ascension, Jesus said, “Go and make
          disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
          of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey
          everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to
          the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:19–20). These instructions
          specify that the church is responsible to teach Jesus’ word, make
          disciples, and baptize those disciples. These things are to be done
          everywhere (“all nations”) until “the very end of the age.” So, if for
          no other reason, baptism has importance because Jesus commanded it.

        <h2>Abraham</h2>

          The life of Abraham takes up a good portion of the Genesis narrative
          from his first mention in Genesis 11:26 all the way to his death in
          Genesis 25:8. Although we know much about Abraham’s life, we know
          little about his birth and early life. When we first meet Abraham, he
          is already 75 years old. Genesis 11:28 records that Abraham’s father,
          Terah, lived in Ur, an influential city in southern Mesopotamia
          situated on the Euphrates River about halfway between the head of the
          Persian Gulf and the modern-day city of Baghdad. We also learn that
          Terah took his family and set off for the land of Canaan but instead
          settled in the city of Haran in northern Mesopotamia (on the trade
          route from ancient Babylonia about halfway between Nineveh and
          Damascus).

            There is much we can learn from the life of the apostle Paul. Far
            from ordinary, Paul was given the opportunity to do extraordinary
            things for the kingdom of God. The story of Paul is a story of
            redemption in Jesus Christ and a testimony that no one is beyond the
            saving grace of the Lord. However, to gain the full measure of the
            man, we must examine his dark side and what he symbolized before
            becoming “the Apostle of Grace.” Paul’s early life was marked by
            religious zeal, brutal violence, and the relentless persecution of
            the early church. Fortunately, the later years of Paul’s life show a
            marked difference as he lived his life for Christ and for the
            advancement of His kingdom.

        <h2>What charges do the crowd in Jerusalem make against Paul?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            After Paul’s third missionary journey, Paul traveled to Jerusalem,
            despite knowing he would be arrested. He first reported to James,
            the half-brother of Jesus and head of the church in Jerusalem, as
            well as the elders. Paul also learned that some Jewish believers in
            Jerusalem had a warped idea of his work. They had been told that
            Paul pushed Jewish believers in Asia Minor and Macedonia to reject
            Jewish customs, including circumcision. In order to prove that Paul
            respected the laws of Moses, the elders asked him to participate in
            the ceremony for four men who were ending their vow (probably a
            Nazirite vow). Paul did as the elders requested, showing that he was
            not anti-Law or opposed to Jewish customs (Acts 21:17–26).

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The Bible does not say how the apostle Paul died. Writing in 2
            Timothy 4:6–8, Paul seems to be anticipating his soon demise: “For I
            am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my
            departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished
            the race, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me
            the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge,
            will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who
            have loved his appearing.”

            After Jesus rose from the dead, He "presented Himself alive" (Acts
            1:3) to the women near the tomb (Matthew 28:9-10), to His disciples
            (Luke 24:36-43), and to more than 500 others (1 Corinthians 15:6).
            In the days following His resurrection, Jesus taught His disciples
            about the kingdom of God (Acts 1:3).

        <h2>What does Baptized in the Sprit mean?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            The baptism of the Holy Spirit may be defined as that work whereby
            the Spirit of God places the believer into union with Christ and
            into union with other believers in the body of Christ at the moment
            of salvation. The baptism of the Holy Spirit was predicted by John
            the Baptist (Mark 1:8) and by Jesus before He ascended to heaven:
            “For John baptized with water, but in a few days you will be
            baptized with the Holy Spirit” (Acts 1:5). This promise was
            fulfilled on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1–4); for the first time,
            people were permanently indwelt by the Holy Spirit, and the church
            had begun.

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Sanctification is God’s will for us (1 Thessalonians 4:3). The word
            sanctification is related to the word saint; both words have to do
            with holiness. To “sanctify” something is to set it apart for
            special use; to “sanctify” a person is to make him holy.

        <h2>How was Abraham's faith tested regarding his son, Isaac?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Abraham’s faith would be tested regarding his son, Isaac. In Genesis
            22, God commands Abraham to sacrifice Isaac on the top of Mount
            Moriah. We don’t know how Abraham reacted internally to this
            command. All we see is Abraham faithfully obeying the God who was
            his shield (Genesis 15:1) and who had been extraordinarily gracious
            and good to him up to this point. As with the earlier command to
            leave his home and family, Abraham obeyed (Genesis 22:3). We know
            the story ends with God holding back Abraham from sacrificing Isaac,
            but imagine how Abraham must have felt. He had been waiting decades
            for a son of his own, and the God who promised this child to him was
            about to take him away. The point is that Abraham’s faith in God was
            greater than his love for his son, and he trusted that even if he
            sacrificed Isaac, God was able to bring him back from the dead
            (Hebrews 11:17-19).

        <h2>What is the main lesson to be learned from Abraham's life?</h2>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            One obvious lesson to draw from Abraham’s life is that we are to
            live a life of faith. Abraham could take his son Isaac up to Mount
            Moriah because he knew God was faithful to keep His promises.
            Abraham’s faith wasn’t a blind faith; his faith was a settled
            assurance and trust in the One who had proved Himself faithful and
            true. If we were to look back on our own lives, we would see the
            hand of God’s providence all over it. God doesn’t have to visit us
            accompanied by angels or speak from burning bushes or part the sea
            waters to be active in our lives. God is superintending and
            orchestrating the events of our lives. Sometimes it may not seem
            that way, but Abraham’s life is evidence that God’s presence in our
            lives is real. Even Abraham’s failures demonstrate that God, while
            not protecting us from the consequences of our sin, graciously works
            His will in us and through us; nothing we do will thwart His plan.
